# Covalent light-client installer 
WELCOME, and don't forget to leave a star to my project :) 

Update feature :
1. Better notification report on telegram BOT
2. Multi port for ipfs and light-client
3. Backup and Migrate, so if there is an update you can upgrade without input anything again
4. Auto ipfs setting with dht acceleration
5. Auto restart the ipfs service if there is an error on it

We will update more feature soon ! so stay tune !

## Why you must install from the source ?
It's so efficient, and easy if you facing any error from the ipfs daemon, because the process is running separately, you can just restart it without restarting the main node. And you can run multiple client in ONE server ðŸ¤«
## EWM light-client setup auto installer
```
sudo rm -rf ewm_install.sh && wget https://github.com/mr9868/ewm-light-client/blob/main/ewm_install.sh && chmod 777 ewm_install.sh && bash ewm_install.sh && sudo rm ewm_install.sh
```
To check the main node logs :
```
screen -r covalent
```
To check the ipfs daemon logs :
```
screen -r ipfs
```

if you facing any error on the ipfs daemon you can just :
``` 
screen -r ipfs
```
then ctrl + c to stop,
then restart again :
```
ipfs daemon --init
```
then close again the screen by pressing ctrl + a +d

To add light-client, just rerun the ewm_install.sh
